## Architectural Patterns

### Feature-First Organization
Code is organized around business domains rather than technical concerns, making it easier to locate and maintain related functionality.

### Component-Driven Development
UI is built using a composable component approach, with a clear hierarchy from primitive components to complex feature components.

### State Management Pattern
- **UI State**: Managed locally with useState or useReducer
- **Global State**: Managed with Zustand stores
- **Server State**: Managed with TanStack Query

### Responsive Design Strategy
The application uses a mobile-first approach with responsive breakpoints to ensure usability across all device sizes.
